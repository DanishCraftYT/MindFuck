originally i wrote MindFuck in Python however that was a while ago and my programming skills where still awful so i waited till now with making a new version.
since then i have learned C++ which has allowed me to do things i otherwise couldn't. anyways the "MindFuckPython" repo can be found [here](https://github.com/DanishCraftYT/MindFuckPython).<br>
